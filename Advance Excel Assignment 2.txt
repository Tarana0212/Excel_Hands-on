                                                                 Advance Excel Assignment 2

1. What does the dollar($) sign do?

Ans. Indicates absolute cell references in formulas.
     When you use a $ sign before the cell reference (such as $C$2), you’re telling Excel to keep referring to cell C3 even when you copy and paste the formula.

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?

Ans. Select the cell that contains the formula.

     In the formula bar , select the reference that you want to change.

     Press F4 to switch between the reference types.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?

Ans. Excel solves formulas in the following order:

     Parentheses

     Reference operators

     Negation

     Percent

     Exponents 

     Multiplication and Division

     Addition and Subtraction

     Concatenation

     Logical operators

     Note: If a formula contains multiple operators with the same priority (e.g. multiplication and division, or addition and subtraction), 
           Excel will evaluate the operators from left to right.

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
for any of two?

Ans. The syntax formula for sum function is “=SUM” (number1, number2, etc.).

     The syntax formula for text function is “=TEXT” (value, format_text).

     The syntax formula for the average function is “AVERAGE” (number1, number2, etc.).

     The syntax formula for the concatenate function is “CONCATENATE” (text1, [text2…text_n]),

     The VLookup formula is “=VLOOKUP” (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, *range_lookup*).

5. When would you use the subtotal function?

Ans. Sometimes, we need data based on different categories. SUBTOTALS help us to get the totals of several columns of data broken down into various categories.
     Subtotal function returns a subtotal in a list or database.
     SUBTOTAL can return a SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, and others.
     SUBTOTAL function can either include or exclude values in hidden rows.

6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?

Ans. =VLOOKUP(What you want to look up, where you want to look for it, the column number in the range containing the value to return, return an Approximate or Exact match – indicated as 1/TRUE, or 0/FALSE).

     lookup_value - It is the value to be found in the first column of the table.

     table_array - It is a table of text, numbers or logical values. Table_array can be a cell reference or a range name.

     col_index_num - It is the column number in table_array from which the matching value should be returned.

     range_lookup -
     1 (TRUE) - Find the closest match in first column sorted in ascending order.
     0 (FALSE) - Find an exact match

     Note : If you don't enter a value in the fourth parameter "range_lookup" of vlookup, excel will consider 1 as a logical value i.e. closest match.
